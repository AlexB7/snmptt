<h2><b>SNMPTTCONVERT</b></h2>
<p>Some vendors provide a file that can be imported into HP Openview using a
HP Openview utiltity.&nbsp; <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SNMPTTCONVERT</span> is a simple Perl script which will
convert one of these files into the format used by SNMPTT.&nbsp; The file can
contain multiple traps.</p>
<p>For example, if the file ciscotrap.txt contained:</p>
<blockquote>rpsFailed {.1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3} 6 5 - "Status Events" 1<br />
Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1<br />
SDESC<br />
"A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists
in<br />
the power system."<br />
EDESC</blockquote>
Executing snmpttconvert ciscotrap.txt would output:
<blockquote>#<br />
#<br />
#<br />
EVENT rpsFailed .1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3.0.5 "Status Events" Normal<br />
FORMAT Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1<br />
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Trap received from enterprise $E with $#
arguments: sysName=$1"<br />
SDESC<br />
"A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists
in<br />
the power system."<br />
EDESC</blockquote>
<p><br />
Note:&nbsp; The #EXEC line is added by default.&nbsp; This can be changed by
editing the SNMPTTCONVERT script.<br />
