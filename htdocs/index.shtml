    <p><b>Web site launch</b></p>
    <p>Although long overdue, the domain <a target="snmptt" href="http://www.snmptt.org">snmptt</a> has been registered, and this new web site has been created.  The layout and look of the site is based on the <a target="Nagios" href="http://www.nagios.org">Nagios</a> web site, so special thanks to Ethan!</p>
    <p>The old web page was the readme.html file included in the package, and is available from the <a href="docs.html">Documentation</a> menu item on the left.</p>
  
    <p>Over time the documentation will be cleaned up with hopefully a multi-page format and a tutorial section to help new users as the size of current documentation can be a bit intimidating at first.  The basic use of SNMPTT is actually quite simple, but things can get complex when using new features such as REGEX.</p>
