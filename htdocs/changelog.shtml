<p class="SectionTitle">Change Log</p>

<u>v1.1 - January 17th, 2006</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
  <li>Added <b>PREEXEC</b> <b>snmptt.conf</b> file option to allow an external 
  program to be run before processing the FORMAT and EXEC lines.
  The output of the external program is stored in the <b>$p<i>n</i></b> variable
  where <b><i>n</i></b> is a number starting from 1.  Multiple <b>PREEXEC</b> lines
  are permitted.  The first <b>PREEXEC</b> stores the result of the
  command in <b>$p1</b>, the second in <b>$p2</b> etc.  Any ending newlines
  are removed.  The <b>snmptt.ini</b> parameter <b>pre_exec_enable</b> can be used
  to enable / disable it.</li>
  <li><b>MATCH</b> statement now accepts any variable name instead of only enterprise variables.  Example: MATCH $s:(Normal)</li>
  <li>Added <b>NODES MODE=</b> snmptt.conf file option to allow you to select either <b>POS</b> (positive - the default) or <b>NEG</b> (negative) for <b>NODES</b> matches.  If set to <b>NEG</b>, then <b>NODES</b> is a 'match' only if <i>none</i> of the <b>NODES</b> entries match.</li>
  <li>Added <b>unknown_trap_exec</b> <b>snmptt.ini</b> option.  If defined, the 
  command will be executed for ALL unknown traps.  Passed to the
  command will be all standard and enterprise variables, similar 
  to <b>unknown_trap_log_file</b> but without the newlines.</li>
  <li><b>snmptt --dump</b> which dumps all the configured EVENTs, now displays duplicate 
  EVENT entries to assist with troubleshooting duplicate entries trap logs.</li>
  <li>If the debug log file can not be opened, a message is now logged
  to syslog if <b>syslog_system_enable</b> is enabled, and to the 
  Event Log if <b>eventlog_system_enable</b> is enabled</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with PostgreSQL where some trap data was interpreted as 'placeholders'
  in the INSERT statement which caused logging errors.  PostgreSQL now uses
  PREPARE / EXECUTE statements instead.
  <li>MySQL now uses PREPARE / EXECUTE statements instead of a single INSERT statement.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in <b>NODES</b> where <b>NODES</b> entries from previous EVENTs were not being purged correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where <b>snmptt --dump</b> would attempt to log to syslog or the Event Log.
  <li>Fixed bug that prevented the wildcard <b>.*</b> from being accepted on the EVENT line.</li>
  <li>Added Windows Event Log forwarding documentation to integration section.
  <li>SNMPTTConvertMIB:</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug when <b>--format_desc=n</b> was used that caused extra trailing whitespaces 
    to be added for every non existent line in the description.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented some MIBs from being accepted due to
    spacing in the <b>DEFINITIONS::= line</b>.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in that prevented <b>--ARGUMENTS {}</b> from being parsed 
    due to spacing.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

<u>v1.0 - September 1st, 2004</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
  <li>SQL database connections are now opened after forking to the background when running in daemon mode, and after changing users when running SNMPTT as a non-root user. This should prevent 'gone away' and other connection problems with SQL databases due to lost handles.</li>
  <li>Added mysql_ping_on_insert, postgresql_ping_on_insert and dbd_odbc_ping_on_insert options to 'ping' the database before doing an INSERT. Also added the options mysql_ping_interval, postgresql_ping_interval and dbd_odbc_ping_interval to periodically ping the database. These options will help ensure the connection to the database remains available. If an error is returned, it will attempt to reconnect to the database. This should prevent SNMPTT from having to be restarted if the SQL server is not available due to an outage or a connection timeout due to no activity.</li>
  <li>Added variable substitution $Fz which when used on an EXEC line will dump the translated FORMAT line. This will allow for simplified EXEC lines when they are the same as the FORMAT line (minus the command to execute of course).</li>
  <li>Added variable substitutions $Fa, $Ff, $Fn, $Fr, $Ft, for alarm (bell), form feed (FF), newline (LF, NL), return (CR) and tab (HT, TAB)</li>
  <li>Added variable substitution $D to dump the description text for FORMAT and EXEC lines. The descriptions can be pulled from either the SNMPTT.CONF or MIB files. This is controlled by the description_mode and description_clean snmptt.ini options.</li>
  <li>Added support for logging unknown traps to a SQL table</li>
  <li>Added logging of statistical information for total traps received, total traps translated, total traps ignored and total unknown traps. Statistics are logged at shut down, and optionally at a defined interval defined by the new snmptt.ini variable statistics_interval. Logging can also be forced by sending the SIGUSR1 signal, or by creating a file called !statistics in the spool folder.</li>
  <li>Added the error number reported by MySQL to MySQL errors (system syslog, eventlog etc)</li>
  <li>Added /usr/local/etc/snmp and /usr/local/etc paths to the list of default directories searched for snmptt.ini.</li>
  <li>Added some friendly error messages when required Perl modules are not available</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with with handling traps in symbolic format (snmptrapd without -On)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with with using printing $ symbols in FORMAT and EXEC lines</li>
  <li>Added Simple Event Correlator (SEC) integration documentation</li>
  <li>SNMPTTConvertMIB:</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented the variable list (OBJECTS) of V2 MIB files from being converted</li>
    <li>Fixed bug that caused an infinite loop processing the VARIABLES/OBJECTS section if the line in the MIB file contained spaces after the closing bracket</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<u>v0.9 - November 3rd, 2003</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
<li>Syslog messages are now logged with snmptt[<i>pid</i>] instead of TRAPD for traps, and snmptt-sys[<i>pid</i>] instead of SNMPTT for system messages</li>
<li>Added the option daemon_uid which causes snmptt to change to a different user (uid) after launching on Unix systems running in daemon mode</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented ip addresses from being detected correctly with translate_value_oids</li>
<li>Fixed bug with MATCH that caused integer ranges from not being handled correctly</li>
<li>Separated SNMPTT, SNMPTTCONVERT, SNMPTTCONVERTMIB and FAQ / Troubleshooting documentation into separate documents</li>
</ul>
<br />

<u>v0.8 - September 16th, 2003</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
<li>Added MATCH keyword support to allow trap matching based on
values contained inside the trap enterprise variables</li>
<li>REGEX now supports substitution with captures and the modifiers
i, g and e. The e modifier allows for complex REGEX
expressions.</li>
<li>Added support for remote MySQL and PostgreSQL databases</li>
<li>Added PostgreSQL support for DBD:Pg</li>
<li>An EVENT can now contain mulitple EXEC lines</li>
<li>An EVENT can now contain mulitple NODES lines</li>
<li>Added the option dynamic_nodes to allow NODES files to be
either loaded at startup or loaded each time an EVENT is
processed</li>
<li>Added trapoid column for database logging to contain the actual
trap received. The eventid column will contain the actual matched
entry from the .conf file (which could be a wildcard OID)</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented some variables from displaying the
correct values because the received trap OID was replaced with the
actual EVENT entry</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused OIDs not to be translated correctly with
translate_value_oids enabled</li>
<li>Agent IP address is now used instead of 'host' IP address for
NODES matches, the 'hostname' column in database logs and the $A
variable</li>
<li>Variable $A now prints the agent host name. $aA prints the
agent IP address.</li>
<li>Variable $E now prints the enterprise in symbolic form. $e
prints the numeric OID</li>
<li>Variable $O now prints the trap in symbolic form. $o prints the
numeric OID</li>
<li>Added new variable substitution $i to print the actual matched
entry from the .conf file (which could be a wildcard OID)</li>
<li>Added the configuration option dns_enable to enable DNS lookups
on host and agent IP addresses</li>
<li>If DNS is enabled, NODES entries are resolved to IP addresses
and the IP address is used to perform the match. This will allow
for aliases to be used.</li>
<li>Added the option resolve_value_ip_addresses to resolve ip
addresses contained inside enterprise variable values</li>
<li>Changed snmptt.ini setting translate_trap_oid to
translate_log_trap_oid</li>
<li>Changed snmptt.ini setting translate_oids to
translate_value_oids</li>

db_translate_enterprise</li>
<li>$O follows translate_trap_oid_format, and $o is always the
numerical trap OID</li>
<li>$E follows translate_enterprise_oid_format, and $e is always
the numerical enterprise OID</li>
<li>The enterprise column when logging to a database now follows
the db_translate_enterprise setting</li>
<li>Fixed bug with $# to report the correct number of enterprise
variables (was 1 lower than it should have been)</li>
<li>Fixed bug with handling traps that contain quoted values that
span multiple lines</li>
<li>PID file now created (/var/run/snmptt.pid or ./snmptt.pid) when
running in daemon mode on Linux / Unix. snmptt-init.d script
updated to remove the pid file when shutting down snmptt.</li>
<li>Added Nagios / Netsaint integration documentation</li>
<li>Added contrib folder</li>
<li>Snmpttconvertmib</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Now prints the variables contained in each trap definition
unless --no_variables is set. When using --net_snmp_perl it will
also resolve the Syntax (INTEGER, OCTETSTR etc) and Description. If
it's an INTEGER, will also print out the enumeration tags if any
exist.</li>
<li>Improved compatability with MIB files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>v0.7 - April 17th, 2003</u><br />

<li>Fixes a vulnerability that prevents the possibility of injected
commands contained in traps from being executed when using the EXEC
feature</li>
<li>Added the ability for traps passed from snmptrapd or loaded
from the snmptt.conf files to contain symbolic OIDs such as
linkDown and IF-MIB::linkUp. This feature requires the UCD-SNMP /
Net-SNMP Perl module</li>
<li>Added the configuration options translate_trap_oid and
translate_oids to have the trap OID and OID values contained in the
trap variables converted from numerical OID to symbolic form before

DBD::PgPP</li>
<li>Added REGEX keyword support to allow user definable search and
replace on FORMAT / EXEC lines</li>
<li>NODES entry can now contain a CIDR address (eg:
192.168.10.0/23), or a network range
(192.168.10.0-192.168.11.255)</li>
<li>NODES entry can now contain a mix of host names, IP addresses,
CIDR addresses, network ranges and filenames</li>
<li>Added the ability to force a reload of the configuration files
while running in daemon mode by placing a file called !reload in

translations of numeric and symbolic OIDS to assist with
determining if the installed Perl module will function as expected
with SNMPTT</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented quoted text from being logged
correctly to SQL databases</li>
<li>Fixed bug that would prevent the translation of integer values
to enumeration tags and variable name substitutions when using
Net-SNMP 5.0.x</li>

does not exist)</li>
<li>--#SUMMARY and DESCRIPTION</li>
<li>DESCRIPTION and --#SUMMARY</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When using the DESCRIPTION to build the FORMAT / EXEC line, can
now choose between using the first line of the DESCRIPTION field,
or the first x number of sentences</li>
<li>The use of the --#SUMMARY and DESCRIPTION line for the FORMAT /
EXEC line can be disabled</li>
