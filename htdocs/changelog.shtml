<u>v1.4 - November 6th, 2013</u>
<ul>
<li>Added <span style="font-weight: bold;">snmptt.ini</span> option
<span style="font-weight: bold;">net_snmp_perl_cache_enable</span>
to enable caching of Net-SNMP Perl module OID and ENUM
translations.&nbsp; This may speed up translations and reduce CPU
load when <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">net_snmp_perl_enable</span> and <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">translate_*</span> options are enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with snmptthandler-embedded where IP addresses and
OIDs were not being detected properly because they contained
'OID:', 'IpAddress:' etc.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with MATCH.&nbsp; The PREEXEC $p variable could not
be used with MATCH.&nbsp; PREEXEC is now executed first if MATCH
contains $p.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with syslog.&nbsp; Log entries were supposed to be
logged with snmptt[pid] but instad of the pid it was actually the
effective user ID (2980512).</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the hostname is not detected properly when
snmptrapd is configured to not use DNS.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where if the spool directory is not defined, files
may be deleted from the wrong folder (3020696).</li>
<li>Fixed bug with syslog logging.&nbsp; Function was not being
called properly (3166749).</li>
<li>Fixed bug with MATCH where number ranges were not working
(3397982).</li>
<li>Fixed bug with multi-line traps (2915658).</li>
<li>Fixed bug with LOGONLY severity.&nbsp; EXEC was being executed
even if the trap had a severity of LOGONLY (3567744).</li>
<li>Fixed bug with snmptt hanging if the log message sent to syslog
contained a % symbol. &nbsp;All %'s are now escaped before sending
to syslog (3567748).</li>
<li>Fixed possible bug with MySQL.&nbsp; Put CONNECT string on one
line.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with not being able to write to the debug log file
when running snmptt as non-root if the debug file didn't already
exist with the correct permissions at startup.&nbsp; The ownership
of snmptt.debug is now set to daemon_uid before switching to the
new uid.&nbsp; Patch 3423525.</li>
<li>Installation documentation updates (bug 3425999).</li>
</ul>

<u>v1.3 - November 15th, 2009</u>

snmptrapd embedded Perl version of snmptthandler.</li>
<li>Added variable substitutions <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">$Be</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">$Bu</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">$BE</span> and <span style=

for start / stop so that it starts after snmptrapd and stops before
snmptrapd.</li>
<li>Changed the default log path to <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">/var/log/snmptt</span> for Unix and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\snmpt\log</span> for Windows to
make it easier to grant write permission to the
snmptt&nbsp;process.</li>
<li>Changed umask for log files to 002 to ensure they are not
created as world writable.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the the PID file was being created using the
parent (root) PID instead of the child (daemon_uid) when daemon_uid
is used.</li>
<li>The DEBUG log file will now be re-opened when a HUP signal is
sent.</li>
<li>When debugging is enabled, flush buffers every sleep cycle so
we can tail the debug log file.</li>
<li>Don't print messages to the console when starting in daemon
mode unless debugging is enabled or an error occurs.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<u>v1.2 - June 16th, 2007</u>
<ul>
<li>When <b>daemon_uid</b> is used, two processes will now be
spawned. The first process will be run as the same user that
started SNMPTT (which should be root). The second will run as the
<b>daemon_uid</b> user. This was changed so that SNMPTT could
properly clean up the pid file on exit.</li>
<li>Added <span style="font-weight: bold;">snmptt.ini</span> option
<b>pid_file</b> to allow for custom pid file locations when running
in daemon mode.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where pid file did not contain the current pid of

<li>Added <b>snmptt.ini</b> options <b>date_format</b>,
<b>time_format</b>, <b>date_time_format</b>,
<b>date_time_format_sql</b> and <b>stat_time_format_sql</b> to
allow the output format for <b>$x</b> and <b>$X</b> substitution
variables, and the format of the date/time for text logs and SQL to
be changed using <b>strftime()</b> variables. This allows for

<span style="font-weight: bold;">log_system_file</span>.</li>
<li>Added a work-around to the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1638225&amp;group_id=12694&amp;atid=112694">
Net-SNMP v5.4 traphandle bug (1638225)</a> where the host name was
set to &lt;UNKNOWN&gt;. When detected, SNMPTT will use the host IP
address instead.</li>
<li>Added a <b>$H</b> variable substitution to give the host name
of the computer that is running SNMPTT, or a user defined value
specified in the new <b>snmptt_system_name</b> <b>snmptt.ini</b>
option.</li>
<li>Added MATCH support for bitwise AND</li>
<li>Added <b>snmptt.ini</b> option <b>exec_escape</b> to escape
wildards (* and ?) in EXEC, PREEXEC and the unknown_trap_exec
commands. This is enabled by default for Linux and Unix (or
anything non-Windows) to prevent the wildcards from being expanded
by the shell.</li>
<li>Moved <b>unknown_trap_exec</b> to Exec section in
<b>snmptt.ini</b>.</li>
<li>Added 'use strict' pragma in source code.</li>
<li>Experimental: &nbsp;Added threads (Perl ithreads) support for
EXEC. When enabled, EXEC commands will launch in a thread to allow
SNMPTT to continue processing other traps. Added <b>snmptt.ini</b>
options <b>threads_enable</b> and <b>threads_max</b>.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where snmptt tried to log to syslog when changing
UIDs even if syslog_system_enable was set to 0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in REGEX with handling of captures.
&nbsp;Text::Balanced module is now required.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug under Windows where SNMPTT was trying to log to

SNMP traps as heartbeats by using freshness checks.</li>
<li>Added information to Nagios section of documentation for using
freshness checks to automatically clear trap alerts.</li>
<li>SNMPTTConvertMIB:</li>
<li style=
"list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug (1438794) where a TRAP-TYPE / NOTIFICATION-TYPE
line would not translate if it was split across two lines.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug (1438394) where ARGUMENTS lines that have $1, $2
etc instead of %0, %1 would not translate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a --#SEVERITYMAP line would be used instead
of --#SEVERITY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<u>v1.1 - January 17th, 2006</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
  <li>Added <b>PREEXEC</b> <b>snmptt.conf</b> file option to allow an external 
  program to be run before processing the FORMAT and EXEC lines.
  The output of the external program is stored in the <b>$p<i>n</i></b> variable
  where <b><i>n</i></b> is a number starting from 1.  Multiple <b>PREEXEC</b> lines
  are permitted.  The first <b>PREEXEC</b> stores the result of the
  command in <b>$p1</b>, the second in <b>$p2</b> etc.  Any ending newlines
  are removed.  The <b>snmptt.ini</b> parameter <b>pre_exec_enable</b> can be used
  to enable / disable it.</li>
  <li><b>MATCH</b> statement now accepts any variable name instead of only enterprise variables.  Example: MATCH $s:(Normal)</li>
  <li>Added <b>NODES MODE=</b> snmptt.conf file option to allow you to select either <b>POS</b> (positive - the default) or <b>NEG</b> (negative) for <b>NODES</b> matches.  If set to <b>NEG</b>, then <b>NODES</b> is a 'match' only if <i>none</i> of the <b>NODES</b> entries match.</li>
  <li>Added <b>unknown_trap_exec</b> <b>snmptt.ini</b> option.  If defined, the 
  command will be executed for ALL unknown traps.  Passed to the
  command will be all standard and enterprise variables, similar 
  to <b>unknown_trap_log_file</b> but without the newlines.</li>
  <li><b>snmptt --dump</b> which dumps all the configured EVENTs, now displays duplicate 
  EVENT entries to assist with troubleshooting duplicate entries trap logs.</li>
  <li>If the debug log file can not be opened, a message is now logged
  to syslog if <b>syslog_system_enable</b> is enabled, and to the 
  Event Log if <b>eventlog_system_enable</b> is enabled</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with PostgreSQL where some trap data was interpreted as 'placeholders'
  in the INSERT statement which caused logging errors.  PostgreSQL now uses
  PREPARE / EXECUTE statements instead.
  <li>MySQL now uses PREPARE / EXECUTE statements instead of a single INSERT statement.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in <b>NODES</b> where <b>NODES</b> entries from previous EVENTs were not being purged correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where <b>snmptt --dump</b> would attempt to log to syslog or the Event Log.
  <li>Fixed bug that prevented the wildcard <b>.*</b> from being accepted on the EVENT line.</li>
  <li>Added Windows Event Log forwarding documentation to integration section.
  <li>SNMPTTConvertMIB:</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug when <b>--format_desc=n</b> was used that caused extra trailing whitespaces 
    to be added for every non existent line in the description.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented some MIBs from being accepted due to
    spacing in the <b>DEFINITIONS::= line</b>.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in that prevented <b>--ARGUMENTS {}</b> from being parsed 
    due to spacing.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

<u>v1.0 - September 1st, 2004</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
  <li>SQL database connections are now opened after forking to the background when running in daemon mode, and after changing users when running SNMPTT as a non-root user. This should prevent 'gone away' and other connection problems with SQL databases due to lost handles.</li>
  <li>Added mysql_ping_on_insert, postgresql_ping_on_insert and dbd_odbc_ping_on_insert options to 'ping' the database before doing an INSERT. Also added the options mysql_ping_interval, postgresql_ping_interval and dbd_odbc_ping_interval to periodically ping the database. These options will help ensure the connection to the database remains available. If an error is returned, it will attempt to reconnect to the database. This should prevent SNMPTT from having to be restarted if the SQL server is not available due to an outage or a connection timeout due to no activity.</li>
  <li>Added variable substitution $Fz which when used on an EXEC line will dump the translated FORMAT line. This will allow for simplified EXEC lines when they are the same as the FORMAT line (minus the command to execute of course).</li>
  <li>Added variable substitutions $Fa, $Ff, $Fn, $Fr, $Ft, for alarm (bell), form feed (FF), newline (LF, NL), return (CR) and tab (HT, TAB)</li>
  <li>Added variable substitution $D to dump the description text for FORMAT and EXEC lines. The descriptions can be pulled from either the SNMPTT.CONF or MIB files. This is controlled by the description_mode and description_clean snmptt.ini options.</li>
  <li>Added support for logging unknown traps to a SQL table</li>
  <li>Added logging of statistical information for total traps received, total traps translated, total traps ignored and total unknown traps. Statistics are logged at shut down, and optionally at a defined interval defined by the new snmptt.ini variable statistics_interval. Logging can also be forced by sending the SIGUSR1 signal, or by creating a file called !statistics in the spool folder.</li>
  <li>Added the error number reported by MySQL to MySQL errors (system syslog, eventlog etc)</li>
  <li>Added /usr/local/etc/snmp and /usr/local/etc paths to the list of default directories searched for snmptt.ini.</li>
  <li>Added some friendly error messages when required Perl modules are not available</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with with handling traps in symbolic format (snmptrapd without -On)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with with using printing $ symbols in FORMAT and EXEC lines</li>
  <li>Added Simple Event Correlator (SEC) integration documentation</li>
  <li>SNMPTTConvertMIB:</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">
    <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented the variable list (OBJECTS) of V2 MIB files from being converted</li>
    <li>Fixed bug that caused an infinite loop processing the VARIABLES/OBJECTS section if the line in the MIB file contained spaces after the closing bracket</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<u>v0.9 - November 3rd, 2003</u>
<ul class="SectionBody">
<li>Syslog messages are now logged with snmptt[<i>pid</i>] instead of TRAPD for traps, and snmptt-sys[<i>pid</i>] instead of SNMPTT for system messages</li>
<li>Added the option daemon_uid which causes snmptt to change to a different user (uid) after launching on Unix systems running in daemon mode</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented ip addresses from being detected correctly with translate_value_oids</li>
<li>Fixed bug with MATCH that caused integer ranges from not being handled correctly</li>

i, g and e. The e modifier allows for complex REGEX
expressions.</li>
<li>Added support for remote MySQL and PostgreSQL databases</li>
<li>Added PostgreSQL support for DBD:Pg</li>
<li>An EVENT can now contain mulitple EXEC lines</li>
<li>An EVENT can now contain mulitple NODES lines</li>
<li>Added the option dynamic_nodes to allow NODES files to be
either loaded at startup or loaded each time an EVENT is
processed</li>
<li>Added trapoid column for database logging to contain the actual
trap received. The eventid column will contain the actual matched
entry from the .conf file (which could be a wildcard OID)</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented some variables from displaying the
correct values because the received trap OID was replaced with the
actual EVENT entry</li>
<li>Fixed bug that caused OIDs not to be translated correctly with
translate_value_oids enabled</li>
<li>Agent IP address is now used instead of 'host' IP address for
NODES matches, the 'hostname' column in database logs and the $A
variable</li>
<li>Variable $A now prints the agent host name. $aA prints the
agent IP address.</li>
<li>Variable $E now prints the enterprise in symbolic form. $e
prints the numeric OID</li>
<li>Variable $O now prints the trap in symbolic form. $o prints the
numeric OID</li>
<li>Added new variable substitution $i to print the actual matched
entry from the .conf file (which could be a wildcard OID)</li>
<li>Added the configuration option dns_enable to enable DNS lookups
on host and agent IP addresses</li>
<li>If DNS is enabled, NODES entries are resolved to IP addresses
and the IP address is used to perform the match. This will allow
for aliases to be used.</li>
<li>Added the option resolve_value_ip_addresses to resolve ip
addresses contained inside enterprise variable values</li>
<li>Changed snmptt.ini setting translate_trap_oid to
translate_log_trap_oid</li>
<li>Changed snmptt.ini setting translate_oids to
translate_value_oids</li>
<li>Added configuraiton settings: translate_enterprise_oid_format,

db_translate_enterprise</li>
<li>$O follows translate_trap_oid_format, and $o is always the
numerical trap OID</li>
<li>$E follows translate_enterprise_oid_format, and $e is always
the numerical enterprise OID</li>
<li>The enterprise column when logging to a database now follows
the db_translate_enterprise setting</li>
<li>Fixed bug with $# to report the correct number of enterprise
variables (was 1 lower than it should have been)</li>
<li>Fixed bug with handling traps that contain quoted values that
span multiple lines</li>
<li>PID file now created (/var/run/snmptt.pid or ./snmptt.pid) when

unless --no_variables is set. When using --net_snmp_perl it will
also resolve the Syntax (INTEGER, OCTETSTR etc) and Description. If
it's an INTEGER, will also print out the enumeration tags if any
exist.</li>
<li>Improved compatability with MIB files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>v0.7 - April 17th, 2003</u><br />
<ul class="SectionBody">
<li>Fixes a vulnerability that prevents the possibility of injected
commands contained in traps from being executed when using the EXEC
feature</li>
<li>Added the ability for traps passed from snmptrapd or loaded
from the snmptt.conf files to contain symbolic OIDs such as
linkDown and IF-MIB::linkUp. This feature requires the UCD-SNMP /
Net-SNMP Perl module</li>
<li>Added the configuration options translate_trap_oid and
translate_oids to have the trap OID and OID values contained in the
trap variables converted from numerical OID to symbolic form before
logging. This feature requires the UCD-SNMP / Net-SNMP Perl
module</li>
<li>Added support for logging of traps using PostgreSQL via DBI /
DBD::PgPP</li>
<li>Added REGEX keyword support to allow user definable search and
replace on FORMAT / EXEC lines</li>
<li>NODES entry can now contain a CIDR address (eg:
192.168.10.0/23), or a network range
(192.168.10.0-192.168.11.255)</li>
<li>NODES entry can now contain a mix of host names, IP addresses,
CIDR addresses, network ranges and filenames</li>
