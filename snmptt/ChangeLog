- Bug fix - some variables were not being cleared causing data 
  from previous traps being merged with newer traps when using
  daemon mode.

September 4th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added variable to allow user to disable forking for daemon mode.
- Cleaned up file / directory error handling for daemon mode
- Tested snmptt in deamon mode and snmptthandler on both Linux
  and Windows NT

September 3rd, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added fork for daemon mode for non Win32 systems
- Fixed minor Win32 file problems and tested deamon mode under 
  Windows NT.  Snmptthandler not tested

August 29th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed reload of configuration file to purge memory first
- Cleaned up spool file error handling for daemon mode
- Added HUP signal to daemon mode to force reload of configuration
  file(s).  Thanks to Stefan Mohr.
- You can now have multiple definitions of the same trap.  Giving
  each entry a different NODES list will allow you to define
  actions for a particular trap based on the node.
  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- NODES file / list now accepts both IP addresses and host 
  names.  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- Lines starting with # in NODES file treated as comment.
  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- Changed @var[3] references to $receivedtrap

August 26th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added snmptthandler script which when run from snmptrapd.conf
  instead of snmptt, will dump received traps (quickly) into
  the directory defined by $spooldirectory to be later processed
  by snmptt running as a daemon.
- Added daemon mode support to snmptt.  snmptt --daemon or 
  setting daemonmode=1 in script to enable.  Looks in 
  $spooldirectory for files to process every $sleeptime seconds.

August 21th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Passed IP address sometimes in the format of
  udp:ipaddress:port.  udp: and :port now removed.  Thanks to
  Ingo Flaschberger.

August 20th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.2.2

August 15th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.2.1
- Added command line options to snmptt: 
    debug, debugfile, dump, help, version, time
- Updated snmpttconvertmib to use also use enterprise when
  running snmptranslate
- Added updated readme.html (readme is text version of
  readme.html which is updated when new versions are released)
- Added sample-trap to CVS.  snmptt < sample-trap to use
- Added support for NOTIFICATION-TYPE v2 MIB files to
  snmpttconvertmib

August 14th, 2002:  Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net> 
- Add first version of SNMPTTCONVERTMIB

July 15th, 2002:  Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net> 
- Changed version to snmptt_0.2 for release

June 15th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Using UCD-SNMP v4.2.3, data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not
  being handled correctly.  Data being passed only contained
  one item per line instead of two.  This appears to be a
  bug with v4.2.3 as it does not happen with v4.2.1 or 
  v4.2.5.  SNMPTT can now work around it but v4.2.3 should NOT 
  be used with SNMPTT especially if SNMP V2 traps are being 
  used.
- Fixed bug when receiving SNMP V2 traps.  SNMPTT was assuming
  the last three variables were the agent IP, community name
  and enterprise, which was incorrect.  It now looks for 
  specific OIDs.  UCD-SNMP V4.2.3 should not be used due
  to the bug mentioned above.

June 13th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Bug fix with $s - Severity.  Thanks to Hugues Mertens

April 18th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Initial release of snmptt_0.1
