- NODES can now contain CIDR address and network ranges.  The NODES line
  can now contain a mix of host names, IP addresses / network ranges 
  and filenames.
- Added option to disable the default of $* in snmpttconvertmib
  when there is no --#SUMMARY line, and the description does not
  contain any variables

March 26th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Translation of integers not working under Net-SNMP 5.0.8 under
  Cygwin.  Reasons:

  Problem #1: UCD-SNMP 4.2.3 allows getType and mapEnum to be passed
  a numerical OID.  Net-SNMP 5.0.8 does not (at least under Cygwin).
  Because of this, we should make sure we use a textual OID instead when 
  calling getType or mapEnum.  It's probably the correct way to do it anyways.	

  Problem #2: UCD-SNMP 4.2.3 translateObject returns the textualOID followed
  by .#, even if it is called with ,0 to use short names.  Net-SNMP 5.0.8
  returns a short name some what correctly, but trails the textual name 
  with a .

- PostgreSQL support via DBD::PgPP
- Changed version to snmptt_0.6.1

March 25th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.6
- Fixed bug in snmptt - domain name strip not working correctly
- Re-fixed bug in snmpttconvertmib that would cause the last trap
  (notification) converted from a v2 MIB file to contain an
  incorrect DESCRIPTION and possibly FORMAT line when the last
  thing in the MIB file is not the last trap definition
  (broken when merging code below).  Applied only to Perl module
  version.

March 24th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Can now specify a NODES entry with snmpttconvertmib

March 23rd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Re-fixed bug in snmpttconvertmib that would cause the last trap
  (notification) converted from a v2 MIB file to contain an
  incorrect DESCRIPTION and possibly FORMAT line when the last
  thing in the MIB file is not the last trap definition
  (broken when merging code below)

March 22nd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Cleanup snmpttconvertmib code - combine V1 and V2 trap conversion
  into one section
- snmpttconvertmib now uses GetOpt::Long for arguments, using --in and
  --out switches for in / out file, --version, --help, --debug.
- Added support to snmpttconvertmib for the NET-SNMP Perl module.  Can
  enable using --net_snmp_perl switch, or run as usual using snmptranslate.
  Must also specify the mib file directory with --mibdir

March 21th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Removed unused emerg ini setting, init $debugcmdline and 
  $debugfilecmdline, remove unused $vartype variable, change a \1 to $1

March 18th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed bug with MySQL database not closing correctly at shutdown due to 
  previous MySQL changes

March 13th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed bug with handling trap data that contains spaces but is not inside of quotes
  for traps received from snmptrapd 4.2.3
- Fixed bug with translation of integers.  If the value could not be translated,
  it should use the non-translated value
- If a variable is passed from snmptrapd that is blank, snmptt will replace it with
  (null)
- snmpttconvertmib now checks the version of snmptranslate before converting
  the mib.  To ensure OIDs are outputted as numerical, the -On switch is added 
  to the snmptranslate command when snmptranslate is v5.0.2 or newer.
  Net-SNMP 5.0.2 and newer (more specifically, snmplib/mib.c version 5.7 or newer 
  in CVS) uses the -On switch to SET numeric OID output.  Anything before 5.0.2 
  is used to TOGGLE the setting.  For older than v5.0.2, the snmp.conf file should
  contain the line:  printNumericOids 1

March 9th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>

- Fixed error messages for SQL and NT event ID numbers.  Udpated docs

February 25th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Updated keep_unlogged_traps option to have SNMPTT erase the spooled trap
  file only after it successfully logs to at least one or all log systems. 
  This will help prevent traps from being lost due to logging problems.

February 24th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added keep_unlogged_traps variable to prevent SNMPTT from deleting the
  spooled trap file if NONE of defined logging systems successfully logged 
  the trap
- Added support for logging of traps using DBD::ODBC
- Cleaned up MySQL code
- Fixed bug with Win32::ODBC connection not being closed on exit of 
  SNMPTT.

- Added support for logging traps to the NT Event Log
- Added syslog and NT Event Log support for SNMPTT 'system' events 
  such as startup, shutdown, errors handling trap spool directory 
  and files.  See readme for info on NT Event Log.
- Added separate debug file for snmptthandler
- Cleaned up defaults code for snmptthandler

February 21st, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added ability to translate integer values to enumeration tags defined
  in MIB files.  Configure using snmptt.ini variables translate_integers
  and mibs_environment.  Requires UCD / NET-SNMP Perl module (SNMP.pm)

February 18th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed bug in snmpttconvertmib that would cause the last trap
  (notification) converted from a v2 MIB file to contain an
  incorrect DESCRIPTION and possibly FORMAT line when the last
  thing in the MIB file is not the last trap definition
- Values passed to snmptt that contained spaces but were not 
  inside of quotes were being treated as multiple variables / 
  values.  Replaced main readtrap code to fix this.

February 15th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.5.1

February 12th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.5
- Changed fqdn_enable ini parameter to strip_domain.  Strip_domain
  can now be 0, 1 or 2.  0 = do not strip domain name.  1 = strip
  domain name.  2 = strip domain name based on list of domains contained
  in strip_domain_list ini parameter.  Defaults to 0.  Note: With 
  fqdn_enable, it defaulted to disable (strip domain).  If you were using
  the CVS version with fqdn_enable set to 0, change strip_domain to 1.
- Added strip_domain_list paramater to ini file

January 23rd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Spool file list sorted before processing to ensure traps are 
  processed in the order they are received when in daemon mode.

January 22nd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed SNMPTTHANDLER to output the current date and time on the
  first line of the spool file.
- Changed SNMPTTHANDLER to v0.2
- Added use_trap_time variable to config file for daemon mode to
  have SNMPTT use either the time from the spool file, or the current
  time.
- Fixed code for default variable settings for .ini file.  Defaults
  were not being set correctly if variable was not defined in .ini
  file.

January 20th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Cleaned up code for determining whether to run as a daemon or
  standalone mode.
- Fix bug with Nodes list not being flushed out when processing 
  multiple traps at once.  Thanks to Christophe Belmont.

January 6th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added fqdn_enable option to remove domain name from host name
  passed to SNMPTT.  Defaults to stripping the domain name (0)

December 3rd, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- By default, snmpttconvertmib will now prepend the --TYPE line 
  to the summary line followed by a ':'.  This can be disabled 
  in the script in the OPTIONS section.  This should create a 
  more descriptive FORMAT / EXEC line.  Example: 
  "Status Trap: NIC switchover to slot $3"

  Windows NT.  Snmptthandler not tested

August 29th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed reload of configuration file to purge memory first
- Cleaned up spool file error handling for daemon mode
- Added HUP signal to daemon mode to force reload of configuration
  file(s).  Thanks to Stefan Mohr.
- You can now have multiple definitions of the same trap.  Giving
  each entry a different NODES list will allow you to define
  actions for a particular trap based on the node.
  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- NODES file / list now accepts both IP addresses and host 
  names.  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- Lines starting with # in NODES file treated as comment.

  instead of snmptt, will dump received traps (quickly) into
  the directory defined by $spooldirectory to be later processed
  by snmptt running as a daemon.
- Added daemon mode support to snmptt.  snmptt --daemon or 
  setting daemonmode=1 in script to enable.  Looks in 
  $spooldirectory for files to process every $sleeptime seconds.

August 21th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Passed IP address sometimes in the format of
  udp:ipaddress:port.  udp: and :port now removed.  Thanks to

- Changed version to snmptt_0.2.1
- Added command line options to snmptt: 
    debug, debugfile, dump, help, version, time
- Updated snmpttconvertmib to use also use enterprise when
  running snmptranslate
- Added updated readme.html (readme is text version of
  readme.html which is updated when new versions are released)
- Added sample-trap to CVS.  snmptt < sample-trap to use
- Added support for NOTIFICATION-TYPE v2 MIB files to

- Changed version to snmptt_0.2 for release

June 15th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Using UCD-SNMP v4.2.3, data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not
  being handled correctly.  Data being passed only contained
  one item per line instead of two.  This appears to be a
  bug with v4.2.3 as it does not happen with v4.2.1 or 
  v4.2.5.  SNMPTT can now work around it but v4.2.3 should NOT 
  be used with SNMPTT especially if SNMP V2 traps are being 
  used.
- Fixed bug when receiving SNMP V2 traps.  SNMPTT was assuming
  the last three variables were the agent IP, community name
  and enterprise, which was incorrect.  It now looks for 
  specific OIDs.  UCD-SNMP V4.2.3 should not be used due
  to the bug mentioned above.

June 13th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Bug fix with $s - Severity.  Thanks to Hugues Mertens
