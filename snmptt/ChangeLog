February 22nd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added separate debug file for snmptthandler
- Cleaned up defaults code for snmptthandler

February 21st, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added ability to translate integer values to enumeration tags defined
  in MIB files.  Configure using snmptt.ini variables translate_integers
  and mibs_environment.  Requires UCD / NET-SNMP Perl module (SNMP.pm)

February 18th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Fixed bug in snmpttconvertmib that would cause the last trap
  (notification) converted from a v2 MIB file to contain an
  incorrect DESCRIPTION and possibly FORMAT line when the last
  thing in the MIB file is not the last trap definition
- Values passed to snmptt that contained spaces but were not 
  inside of quotes were being treated as multiple variables / 
  values.  Replaced main readtrap code to fix this.

February 15th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.5.1

February 12th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Changed version to snmptt_0.5
- Changed fqdn_enable ini parameter to strip_domain.  Strip_domain
  can now be 0, 1 or 2.  0 = do not strip domain name.  1 = strip
  domain name.  2 = strip domain name based on list of domains contained
  in strip_domain_list ini parameter.  Defaults to 0.  Note: With 
  fqdn_enable, it defaulted to disable (strip domain).  If you were using
  the CVS version with fqdn_enable set to 0, change strip_domain to 1.
- Added strip_domain_list paramater to ini file

January 23rd, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Spool file list sorted before processing to ensure traps are 
  processed in the order they are received when in daemon mode.

- Changed SNMPTTHANDLER to output the current date and time on the
  first line of the spool file.
- Changed SNMPTTHANDLER to v0.2
- Added use_trap_time variable to config file for daemon mode to
  have SNMPTT use either the time from the spool file, or the current
  time.
- Fixed code for default variable settings for .ini file.  Defaults
  were not being set correctly if variable was not defined in .ini
  file.

January 20th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Cleaned up code for determining whether to run as a daemon or
  standalone mode.

  multiple traps at once.  Thanks to Christophe Belmont.

January 6th, 2003: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Added fqdn_enable option to remove domain name from host name
  passed to SNMPTT.  Defaults to stripping the domain name (0)

December 3rd, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- By default, snmpttconvertmib will now prepend the --TYPE line 
  to the summary line followed by a ':'.  This can be disabled 
  in the script in the OPTIONS section.  This should create a 
  more descriptive FORMAT / EXEC line.  Example: 
  "Status Trap: NIC switchover to slot $3"

  Variable was not being cleared.

October 18th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>

- Fixed reload of configuration file to purge memory first
- Cleaned up spool file error handling for daemon mode
- Added HUP signal to daemon mode to force reload of configuration
  file(s).  Thanks to Stefan Mohr.
- You can now have multiple definitions of the same trap.  Giving
  each entry a different NODES list will allow you to define
  actions for a particular trap based on the node.
  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.
- NODES file / list now accepts both IP addresses and host 
  names.  Thanks to Ingo Flaschberger.

  instead of snmptt, will dump received traps (quickly) into
  the directory defined by $spooldirectory to be later processed
  by snmptt running as a daemon.
- Added daemon mode support to snmptt.  snmptt --daemon or 
  setting daemonmode=1 in script to enable.  Looks in 
  $spooldirectory for files to process every $sleeptime seconds.

August 21th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Passed IP address sometimes in the format of
  udp:ipaddress:port.  udp: and :port now removed.  Thanks to

- Changed version to snmptt_0.2 for release

June 15th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Using UCD-SNMP v4.2.3, data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not
  being handled correctly.  Data being passed only contained
  one item per line instead of two.  This appears to be a
  bug with v4.2.3 as it does not happen with v4.2.1 or 
  v4.2.5.  SNMPTT can now work around it but v4.2.3 should NOT 
  be used with SNMPTT especially if SNMP V2 traps are being 
  used.
- Fixed bug when receiving SNMP V2 traps.  SNMPTT was assuming
  the last three variables were the agent IP, community name
  and enterprise, which was incorrect.  It now looks for 
  specific OIDs.  UCD-SNMP V4.2.3 should not be used due
  to the bug mentioned above.

June 13th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
