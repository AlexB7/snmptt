- Data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not being handled correctly
  when the passed data only contained one item per line instead
  of two.  In my original testing I always received two items:
  the variable name and the value (eg: sysUpTime and the actual
  uptime).  Some programs such as ev2t for NT did not pass the
  variable name.  If a variable name is missing, it is replaced
  with 'variable'.  This should be invisible to the user as the
  variable names are not used for anything right now.  
- SNMP V2 traps have an unrelated problem as SNMPTT assumes that
  the agent IP address, community name and enterprise will always 
  be passed last from SNMPTRAPD.  Ev2t for example does not pass
  those variables when configured for SNMP V2c.  This needs
  further investigation.
