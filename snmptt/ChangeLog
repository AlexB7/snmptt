  setting daemonmode=1 in script to enable.  Looks in 
  $spooldirectory for files to process every $sleeptime seconds.

June 15th, 2002: Alex Burger <alex_b@users.sourceforge.net>
- Using UCD-SNMP v4.2.3, data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not
  being handled correctly.  Data being passed only contained
  one item per line instead of two.  This appears to be a
  bug with v4.2.3 as it does not happen with v4.2.1 or 
  v4.2.5.  SNMPTT can now work around it but v4.2.3 should NOT 
  be used with SNMPTT especially if SNMP V2 traps are being 
  used.
- Fixed bug when receiving SNMP V2 traps.  SNMPTT was assuming
  the last three variables were the agent IP, community name
  and enterprise, which was incorrect.  It now looks for 
  specific OIDs.  UCD-SNMP V4.2.3 should not be used due
  to the bug mentioned above.
