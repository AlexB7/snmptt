- Data passed from SNMPTRAPD was not being handled correctly
  when the passed data only contained one item per line instead
  of two.  In my original testing I always received two items:
  the variable name and the value (eg: sysUpTime and the actual
  uptime).  When using ev2t for NT, only the value is passed
  to snmptt.  This appears to be a problem with ucd-snmp as
  a packet sniffer is able to decode the variable names 
  correctly.  This is now handled correctly by SNMPTT

- SNMP V2 traps have problem as SNMPTT assumes that the agent 
  IP address, community name and enterprise will always 
  be passed last from SNMPTRAPD.  This needs further investigation.
