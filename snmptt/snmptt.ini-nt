[General]

# daemon: snmptrapd.conf calls snmptthandler
# Ignored by Windows.  See documentation
mode = standalone

# Set to 1 to allow multiple trap definitions to be executed for the same trap.
# Set to 0 to have it stop after the first match.
# Note: Wildcard matches are only matched if there are NO exact matches.  This takes
# 	into consideration the NODES list.  Therefore, if there is a matching trap, but
#	the NODES list prevents it from being considered a match, the wildcard entry will
#	only be used if there are no other exact matches.
multiple_event = 1

# SNMPTRAPD passes the IP address of device sending the trap, and the IP address of the
# actual SNMP agent.  These addresses could differ if the trap was sent on behalf of another
# device (relay, proxy etc).
# If DNS is enabled, the agent IP address is converted to a host name using a DNS lookup
# (which includes the local hosts file, depending on how the OS is configured).  This name
# will be used for: NODES entry matches, hostname field in logged traps (file / database), 
# and the $A variable.  Host names on the NODES line will be resolved and the IP address 
# will then be used for comparing.
# Set to 0 to disable DNS resolution
# Set to 1 to enable DNS resolution
dns_enable = 0

# Set to 0 to enable the use of FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names).  If a host name is
# passed to SNMPTT that contains a domain name, it will not be altered in any way by
# SNMPTT.
# Set to 1 to have SNMPTT strip the domain name from the host name passed to it.  For 
# example, server01.domain.com would be changed to server01
# Set to 2 to have SNMPTT strip the domain name from the host name passed to it
# based on the list of domains in strip_domain_list
strip_domain = 0

# set as server01.city.

# Set to 1 to enable the use of the Perl module from the UCD-SNMP / NET-SNMP package.
# This is required for $v variable substitution to work, and also for some other options
# that are enabled in this .ini file.
# Set to 0 to disable the use of the Perl module from the UCD-SNMP / NET-SNMP package.
# Note: Enabling this with stand-alone mode can cause SNMPTT to run very slowly due to
#       the loading of the MIBS at startup.

# For Net-SNMP 5.1, or any Net-SNMP with patch 722075 applied, set this value to 2.
# A value of 2 is equivalent to -IR on Net-SNMP command line utilities.
# UCD-SNMP and Net-SNMP 5.0.8 and previous may not be able to translate certain formats of
# symbolic names such as RFC1213-MIB::sysDescr.  Net-SNMP 5.1 or patch 722075 will allow
